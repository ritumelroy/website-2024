        Unfortunately, I got sick with a bad case of flu that lasted around 9
        last days of my 14 day term break. I could barely leave my bed and
        missed all my deadlines ðŸ˜­. Term 2 already started by the time I was
        recovering. So I hope to update the deadlines once I am back on track
        with school work, job applications and Online AssesmentsðŸ˜ž

            In my final year as a student, I am eager to embark on a long-term
            project to stay updated on industry trends and sharpen my skills.

            I will start with a basic tech stack like HTML, CSS, and React, then
            gradually incorporate more advanced tools like Tailwind CSS,
            Mantine, and NextJS. I plan to transition from frontend to
            full-stack projects, including React Native and Electron. So please
            check back later as I update this page throughout this year!

            Although I aim for monthly goals, my schedule as a full-time Masters
            student varies, limiting me to planning just two projects at a time.
            Excited to showcase my programming progress as well as my ability
            and willingness to learn new technologies/frameworks!
